Statistical Downscaling of Climate Projections in Pakistan:  From Coarse-Resolution Models to Station-Level Insights with  an Interactive Dashboard Interface 

Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change, underlining the critical 
need for a better understanding of future weather forecasts. Accurate information on ability 
weather events, particularly those involving various greenhouse gas emission scenarios, is critical 
for successful policy design and mitigation initiatives. However, cutting-edge coarse-resolution 
climate models provide generic information that lacks the detail needed for localized decision
making and analysis. 
Our venture is dedicated to improving the accuracy and relevance of weather forecasts for 
Pakistan. We are refining these estimates using complex statistical downscaling methodologies, 
with the goal of providing policymakers, academics, and stakeholders with better tools for 
designing targeted policies for weather-alternative adaptation and mitigation. Finally, we want to 
ensure that decision-makers have access to reliable data so that they can protect Pakistan's 
environment and communities from the effects of climate change.
